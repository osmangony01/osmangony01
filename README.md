Welcome! I'm a passionate computer science graduate student and specialising in web development with expertise in the MERN stack. I am driven by my love for building innovative web applications and solving complex problems.Throughout my career journey, I have honed my skills in full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). My journey as a MERN stack developer has been enriched by practical experiences. I have successfully completed multiple projects, ranging from building dynamic platforms to developing responsive web applications. 


Beyond my technical expertise, I am a strong advocate for effective communication and collaboration. I have had the privilege of working in diverse teams, collaborating with designers, frontend developers, and stakeholders. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, attending tech conferences, or participating in hackathons. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am excited about contributing to innovative solutions that make a positive impact in the world.


Skills: HTML / CSS / JavaScript / React JS / Express JS / MongoDB / Python / Redux
